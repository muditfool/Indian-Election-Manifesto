Tax Policy

    3 Our economic policy has been guidedbythe principle of lowering the taxrateand improvingcompliance; thereby broadening of the tax base. With improved compliance and increased tax base, the tax to GDP ratio has reached 12%, highest in therecentpast, upfrom10.1% in 2013-14. This increasedrevenuehas been deployedforbenefits to the poor and creation of infrastructure at an unprecedented level.Wewill continue with our policy in the similar manner – lowering of taxratetherebyrewardinghonesttaxpayersandimprovingcompliance.

Goods and Service Tax

    4 Goods and ServiceTax(GST) has resulted in overall lowering of tax rates and increasedrevenuecollection, pafiicularlyforStates. When compared to base year of 2015-16, GSTrevenueforall stateshaveincreasedby50% in three years.Wewill continue with the simplification of GST processbyengagingindialoguewithallstakeholders.
